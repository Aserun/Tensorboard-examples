# Tensorboard-examples
This repository explains how to use tensorboard for various datasets

Run the mnist-tensorboard-embeddings-1.py

 After executing the code we can launch TensorBoard by issuing tensorboard --logdir=logs command 
 and opening localhost:6006 in a browser.
 
 For example to call my logs I give a complete path of my log directory in tensorboard command:
 
     tensorboard --logdir=/Technical_works/tensorflow/mnist-tensorboard/log-1 --port=6006
     Then open localhost:6006 in a browser
